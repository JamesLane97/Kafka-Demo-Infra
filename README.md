# Web App Demo - Infrastructure

Simple IaC used to create and manage the Azure infrastructure for my Web App demo project.

The repo containing the demo's artefacts can be found here.

## Description:
Whilst working on this personal project, I wished to achieve the following goals:
 - Employ Terraform best practices
 - Utilise modules to create flexible resuable infrastructure
 - Remote Terraform backend via Azure Storage Accounts
 - Deployed via Azure Service Principal
 - Deploy Artefacts via Ansible
 - Containerise the Web App
 - Develop & demonstrate my skills with both Python (Flask) & JavaScript (Node.js)
 - Eventually merge this project with my scalable Kafka project.
